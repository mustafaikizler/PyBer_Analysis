# PYBER ANALYSIS
## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
PyBer is a Ride-sharing application that operates in multiple locations. By using 2 main CSV files; _ride data_(which contains data such as date, time, unique id, vs..) and _city data_ (which contains data about city names types and number of drivers), we tried to identify and get the results of revenues, number of the ride, number of the driver, weekly fares for each city types in order to make a decision for future.
